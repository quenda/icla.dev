        "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
        authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
        with the Foundation. For legal entities, the entity making a
        Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
        by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
        be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
        including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
        is intentionally submitted by You to the Foundation for inclusion
        in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by
        the Foundation (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
        "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
        communication sent to the Foundation or its representatives,
        including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
        lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
        are managed by, or on behalf of, the Foundation for the purpose of
        discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
        is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
        as "Not a Contribution."

        Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Foundation and to
        recipients of software distributed by the Foundation a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
        Contributions and such derivative works.
     
     </li><li> <b>Grant of Patent License:</b> 
        Subject to the terms and conditions of

        licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
        entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
        that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
        constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
        patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
        that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
        litigation is filed.
